# Assignment 17B
## 1. Objective, Assignment B (1000 points):  

- Look at this sample file: [sample.py](sample.py)
    1. Preview the document You are to write such examples, where you describe the code to be written (starts with #), and the code it should generate. The file shows 3 examples of what text should generate what code. 
    2. write 100 such examples. These are the requirements:
        - if you want the code to print something, then mention "print" in the text
        - read the [sample.py](sample.py) clearly to see the examples and learn from it. If you want the code to write a program, you are NOT asking to write a function. If you want a function, please mention it. 
        - run the code in the terminal/notebook and make sure it runs!
        - you cannot write more than 5 simple functions like add 2/3/4/5 numbers or divide, etc. Try and think of something tough, for example, add a list or tuple together. 
        - stick to python only (no 3rd party library like numpy, etc)
        - here are some examples:
            - provide the length of list, dict, tuple, etc
            - write a function to sort a list
            - write a function to test the time it takes to run a function
            - write a program to remove stop words from a sentence provided,
            - etc
    3. This assignment is of 1000 marks. Each example if 10 marks. If your example is similar to someone else, then you score less. The formula we will use is 10/(repeated example). That means if 10 people write same example, then you get only 1. So think different! (if examples are mentioned here and in the sample file, you will score less)
